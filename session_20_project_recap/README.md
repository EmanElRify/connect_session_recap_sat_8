# Understanding Functions in Python

In this section, we will explore the concept of **functions** in Python. Functions are a fundamental building block in programming that allow us to write reusable and organized code.

## Key Points About Functions:
- A function is a block of code that performs a specific task.
- <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">Functions can take `input parameters` and `return output values.`</span> 
- They help in organizing code into logical blocks, making it easier to read and maintain.
- Functions reduce code repetition and improve reusability.

## Components of a Function:
1. **Function Name**: `The name used to call the function.`
2. **Function Parameters**: The inputs that the function accepts.
3. **Function Logic**: The block of code that defines what the function does.
4. **Function Return**: The output that the function provides after execution.

### Example:
```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("Alice"))
```

> **Note:** Functions are a great way to make your code modular and maintainable.
